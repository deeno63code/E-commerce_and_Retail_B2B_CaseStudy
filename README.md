#Problem statement
This case study of 'Schuster' which is a multinational retail company dealing in sports goods and accessories.
Schuster conducts significant business with hundreds of its vendors, with whom it has credit arrangements. 
Unfortunately, not all vendors respect credit terms and some of them tend to make payments late.
Schuster would thus try to understand its customersâ€™ payment behaviour and predict the likelihood of late payments against open invoices.

#Objective
customer segmentation
Prediction of delayed payment against an unforeseen dataset of transactions with due date yet
